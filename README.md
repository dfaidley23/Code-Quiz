# Code Quiz

## Description
The following App was built to function as a generic Code Quiz. It was built with only a few questions to test your basic Javascript knowledge. If you answer wrong you will have time deducted from your score but this will also create a scoreboard with a list of Highscores so you can keep aiming to get them all right.

## Usage
In order to use the app you simply need to press the "Start Quiz" button. You will then have a timer start counting in the top right of the website. Once this reaches 0 you will fail if you haven't finished your test. If you do finish the timer will stop to show you the time it took to complete the quiz along with a score based on your questions answered correctly.
